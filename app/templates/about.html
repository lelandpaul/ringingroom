<h3>The site</h3>

<p>
    Welcome to Ringing Room! This is a site built for change ringers to continue
    ringing with one another even when socially distanced. It is under
    development currently, and new features may show up with little warning.
    Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you have any issues or
    suggestions.
</p>

<h3>The developers</h3>

<p>
    The Ringing Room is a joint venture by Leland Paul Reimer and Bryn Marie
    Reimer, both ringers in Northampton Massachusetts, USA.
</p>

<h3>The audio</h3>

<p>
    The tower bell audio is provided by
    <a href="http://www.hibberts.co.uk/">Bill Hibbert</a>. The handbell
    recordings are of Leland's bells, with editing and extension by JES.
