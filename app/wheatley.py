"""
A module to contain all the code relating to the interactions of Ringing Room with Wheatley.  All
the technical details are contained in this file and the Wheatley class, and the rest of the code
should only interact with the provided functions.  This provides a separation of concerns, and
allows the Wheatley interfacing code to be adjusted easily to keep up with changes to Wheatley
itself.

# Code overview

## Goals

The biggest concern of this module is to guaruntee the following properties:
- At any time, there is **at most one** Wheatley instance active in any given tower
- After enough inactivity, there should be no Wheatley instances running
- When Wheatley is needed for some ringing, there is _exactly one_ Wheatley instance running in time
  for the start of the ringing (note that this a Wheatley instance is not required immediatley after
  `Look To`, only at the start of the ringing).

## Why I think this system will actually work

This system is makes a number of improvements over the last (broken) system to make it more paranoid
and less likely to fail:

1.  This system never forgets about Wheatley processes.  Therefore, it is explicitly able to recover
    from the situation where multiple Wheatleys exist in the same tower. The old system could only
    track at most one Wheatley in a given room, despite the fact that mistakes sometimes happen -
    this meant that if a 2nd Wheatley instance did somehow appear, the first one would be forgotten
    about forever, leaving it as a 'zombie Wheatley' to mess up the ringing and consume the CPU of
    the RR server.

2.  Secondly, this system detects active Wheatley instances by requiring them to send a WebSocket
    signal (`c_roll_call`) in reply to `Look To`.  This means that if a Wheatley process is running
    but somehow unable to send/recieve socketio messages then it is wasting CPU and memory time and
    will be killed.

3.  Apart from the inactivity timeout, Wheatley instances are always killed by the RR server
    explicitly killing the Wheatley process.  This means that however much a Wheatley instance gets
    its knickers in a twist, we will always be able to kill it.

4.  Wheatley process classes (`Proc`s) are only pronounced to be `STATE_DEAD` when the process
    actually terminates.

5.  This system only creates new Wheatleys if it's absolutely necessary, minimising the number of
    CPU spikes caused by spinning up new python interpreters.

## How the system works

If `Look To` is called and Wheatley is assigned, then a Wheatley instance is needed.  Importantly,
Wheatley is not needed until the 'Look To' sound is finished, giving us ~3 seconds to make sure that
exactly one Wheatley process is active.

However, detecting active Wheatley instances purely by which processes are running is **very**
unreliable (knowledge that we have learned through much trauma with the dev server).  Instead, we
require that Wheatley and the server follow a standard protocol, with the following timeline:

1.  `Look To` is called, and Wheatley is assigned to some bells - Wheatley therefore needs to start
    ringing when `Look To` is finished.  The `Wheatley` class stores the current time in
    `Wheatley._look_to_time` so that any new Wheatleys know when to start ringing.  Nothing else
    happens.

2.  Any active Wheatley instances reply to the `Look To` signal with a 'c_roll_call', to tell the
    server that that Wheatley instance is already active and able to ring.  All the 'roll call'
    replies are registered by the server.

3.  `ROLL_CALL_TIME` seconds after 'Look To' is called, the `Wheatley` class looks at the 'roll call'
    replies to decide what to do.  There are 3 cases:


    ### Case 1: There were no replies

    This means either
      a) there aren't any Wheatley instances
    or
      b) all the existing Wheatley instances are broken in some way.
    Either way, the correct response to this is to kill all existing processes and spawn another.


    ### Case 2: There is exactly one instance and exactly one reply

    In this case, the existing Wheatley instance must be alive and ready to ring, so all is fine.

   
    ### Case 3: There are multiple instances and some non-zero number of replies

    In this case, we have too many instances running.  The server keeps the **newest** instance that
    replied, and all others are killed.

    In fact, case (2) is a special case of (3) (albeit the most likely one) so they are implemented
    together.
