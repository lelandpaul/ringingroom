# virtual-ringing-room

A space where socially-distanced ringers can practice together.

## Build instructions

Get the CSS set up with sass:
 - Install dart-sass (e.g. `brew install sass/sass/sass`); https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases
 - (Optional) Create & activate a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/);
 - Install python dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - In the project root, run `sass app/static/sass/:app/static/css/`. This will compile the sass to css.
 
Get the DB set up with Flask:
 - In the project root, run `flask db upgrade`
 
You are now ready to run the server:
 - In the project root, run `flask run`
 - This will give you a local address where you can access the app

## Events

Communication between client & server is handled by Socket.IO events.

Events are prefixed by *origin*:
- "c_" for client
- "s_" for server


Currently, the following events are defined:

- **c_check_tower_id, {tower_id: Int}**:
  on the landing page, the user has entered a tower_id; check whether it exists
- **s_check_id_success, {tower_name: Str}**:
  tower id did correspond to an extant tower; tell the client the name
- **s_check_id_failure, None**:
  tower id did not correspond to an extant tower
- **c_join_tower_by_id, {tower_id: Int}**:
  user joined a tower by an id
- **s_redirection, Str ("tower_id/tower_name")**:
  send the user to a specific tower
- **c_create_tower, {tower_name: Str}**:
  user entered a tower name; create it
- **c_join, {tower_id: Int}**:
  emitted when the ringing_room page loads
- **c_size_change, {size: Int, tower_id: Int}**,
  **s_size_change, {size: Int}**:
  change the number of bells in a tower
- **s_global_state, {global_bell_state: List(Bool) }**:
  set the positions of all the bells from the server's state
- **s_name_change, {new_name: Str}**:
  set the name of the tower
- **c_audio_change, {old_audio: 'Tower' or 'Hand', tower_id: Int},**
  **s_audio_change, {new_audio: 'Tower' or 'Hand'}**:
  set the audio type
- **c_bell_rung, {bell: Int, stroke: Bool, tower_id: Int}**:
  report ringing a bell
- **s_bell_rung, {global_bell_state: List(Bool), who_rang: Int, disagree: Bool}**:
  broadcast a bell stroke. Disagree indicates that the server & client disagreed
- **{c/s}_call, {call: Str, tower_id: Int}**:
  report & broadcast a call made
