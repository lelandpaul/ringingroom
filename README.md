# ringingroom

A space where socially-distanced ringers can practice together.

## Build instructions

Get the CSS set up with sass:

-   Install dart-sass (e.g. `brew install sass/sass/sass`); https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases
-   (Optional) Create & activate a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/);
-   Install python dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-   In the project root, run `sass app/static/sass/:app/static/css/`. This will compile the sass to css.

Get the DB set up with Flask:

-   In the project root, run `flask db upgrade`

You are now ready to run the server:

-   In the project root, run `flask run`
-   This will give you a local address where you can access the app

### Environment Variables / Feature Flags

A **feature flag** is an environment variable used to enable or disable features at runtime.
They enable the a given feature if they are set to `1`.
If they are not set or set to anything other than `1`, the feature will be disabled.

#### Feature Flags

-   **RR_ENABLE_WHEATLEY**

    If set to `1` Wheatley will be enabled, otherwise Wheatley will be disabled.

-   **RR_WHEATLEY_METHOD_EXTENSION**

    If the stage is changed and this is set to `1`, Wheatley will try to load the same method on the
    new stage. This is disabled by default, because this check sends a request to Bob Wallis'
    blueline website which can block the thread for a long time and therefore cause the method change
    to be too late (if it happens at all).

#### Other Enviroment Variables

-   **RR_WHEATLEY_PATH**

    Set this if you want to run a version of Wheatley that isn't the latest stable version.
    This has to point to the file called `run-wheatley` inside the
    [Wheatley repo](https://github.com/kneasle/wheatley).

    For example:

    ```
    export RR_WHEATLEY_PATH=/path/to/wheatley/run-wheatley
    flask run
    ```

-   **RR_SOCKETIO_PORT**

    Currently used only by Wheatley; defaults to 5000 (the same as Flask), but should be set to
    8080 for a production server.

## API

Ringing Room supplies a basic API for use in 3rd-party apps.

### Version

`GET /api/version`: Gets version information. Responds with the fields:

-   `version`: the overall RR version (which takes the form `YY.WW`, for year and week of release)
-   `api-version`: the api version, which is semantically versioned
-   `socketio-version`: the socketio version, which is semantically versioned

### Authorization

Initial authorization uses HTTP Basic Auth: `POST` to `/api/tokens` with the header `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where `<credentials>` is a base-64-encoded `email:password`. The response will include a bearer token valid for 24 hours.

All other endpoints (except `POST /api/user` for registering new users) require the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### User

`GET /api/user`: Gets user details. Responds with a JSON including the fields `username` & `email`.

`POST /api/user`: Registers new user. Request must include a JSON with fields `username`, `email`, & `password`. Responds as per `GET /api/user`. (Does not require Bearer token.)

`PUT /api/user`: Modifies user details Request JSON may include `new_username`, `new_email`, `new_password`. Responds as per `GET /api/user`.

`DELETE /api/user`: Deletes user.

`POST /api/user/reset_password`: Must include an `email` field in the request JSON; if that email is associated with an account, an email will be sent to reset the password to that account. (Note: For security reasons, this endpoint will always respond with code 200 OK, no matter what email address was included.)

#### Keyboard & Controller parameters

`GET /api/user/keybindings`: Gets all keybindings. Responds with a JSON including fields for each function (e.g "Call Bob" or "Ring left-hand bell"), with values a list of keybindings. (See `config.py` for the default keybindings and a list of all fields this will return.)

`POST /api/user/keybindings`: Update a specific keybinding. Request must include a JSON with a single field named for one of the functions where the value is the complete list of keys bound to that function. Responds as per `GET /api/user/keybindings`.

`DELETE /api/user/keybindings`: Reset either a specific keybinding or all keybindings. Request must include a _string_ which is either a) the name of a specific keybinding function or b) the special key `ALL_KEYBINDINGS`. Responds as per `GET /api/user/keybindings`.

`GET /api/user/controllers`: Gets all controller parameters. Responds with a JSON including fields for each parameter. See `config.py` for the default parameters and a list of all fields this will return.

`POST /api/user/controllers`: Update a specific controller parameter. Request must include a JSON with a single field named for one of the controller parameters. Responds as per `GET /api/user/controllers`.

`DELETE /api/user/controllers`: Resets _all_ controller parameters. Requet body is ignored. Responds as per `GET /api/user/controllers`.

### My_Towers

`GET /api/my_towers`: Gets all related towers:

### Connecting to a Tower

All communication between the API consumer and an individual tower should take place through SocketIO. The basic workflow for setting up communication is:

1. Establish a connection with the `server_address` returned by `GET /api/tower/<tower_id>`.
2. Emit `c_join` with a JSON payload containing `tower_id`, `user_token` (the Bearer token), and `anonymous_user`. **At present, our API doesn't support anonymous users, so this should always have the value `false`.**
3. Listen for `s_set_userlist`, `s_size_change`, `s_audio_change`, `s_host_mode`, `s_user_entered`, and `s_assign_user` to set up the tower.
4. Once you've set up the rope circle, emit `c_request_global_state` and listen for `s_global_state` to set the bells at back/hand.
5. Ring!
6. Emit `c_user_left` when leaving.

### Events

Communication between client & server is handled by Socket.IO events.

Events are prefixed by _origin_:

-   `c_` for client
-   `s_` for server

What follows is a incomplete list of events — these should be only the events relevant to an API consumer (i.e. where functionality is not duplicated elsewhere).

### Wheatley

The integration of Wheatley into Ringing Room have added a number of extra SocketIO signals, used
for keeping Wheatley in sync with the rest of Ringing Room. Some of these signals have custom types
(`RowGen` and `Signals`, which are described in detail below the table.

| Event                        | Payload                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `s_set_wheatley_enabledness` | `{enabled: Bool}`                     | Emitted by the server to the current users of a tower whenever the "Wheatley enabled" switch is changed in the tower settings                                                                                                                                                       |
| `c_wheatley_setting`         | `{tower_id: Int, settings: Settings}` | (from a client) tells Wheatley to change one of its settings                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `s_wheatley_setting`         | `Settings`                            | (from the server) tells Wheatley to change one of its settings, and for all the clients to update their views of that setting.

| `c_wheatley_row_gen`         | `{tower_id: Int, row_gen: RowGen}`    | (from a client) tells Wheatley to use different Row Generation settings next time a `Look to` is called.                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### The 'Settings' type

The _Settings_ type is an object with 0 or more of the following properties:

```
sensitivity             : float; 0 <= x <= 1 (currently unused)
use_up_down_in          : Bool
stop_at_rounds          : Bool
peal_speed              : int; x >= 0
fixed_striking_interval : Bool (ignored by Wheatley, changes `peal_speed` when the tower size is changed)
```

#### The 'RowGen' type

The _RowGen_ type is a JSON representation of the following structured enum
(it's either a `Method` with a `title`, a `stage`, etc.
or it's a `Composition` with a `url` and `title`):

```rust
enum RowGen {
    Method {
        title: String,
        stage: Int,
        notation: String,
        url: String,
        bob: Map<Int, String>,
        single: Map<Int, String>
    },
    Composition {
        url: String,
        title: String
    }
}
```

The `Int`s in the call maps correspond to indices within the lead, and the `String`s are the place notations
that should be made at that position. In JSON, the `RowGen` type corresponds to one of the following
objects:

```
{
    type: "method",
    title: String,
    stage: Int,
    notation: String,
    url: String,
    bob: { Int: String },
    single: { Int: String }
}
/* or */
{
    type: "composition",
    url: String,
    title: String
}
```
